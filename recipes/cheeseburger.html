    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p class="info">
      I tasted these burgers in Athens, Georgia. They were so good that I made
      my own recipe. It combines fresh basil, Gorgonzola cheese, and garlic, and
      it's easy enough for a quick and simple dinner. Serve them on toasted
      sourdough or ciabatta buns.
