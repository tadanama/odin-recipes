      <li>
        In a medium saucepan over medium heat, stir together coconut milk,
        water, ground ginger, ginger root, salt, bay leaf, and rice. Cover, and
        bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until
        done
      </li>
      <li>
        Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring water to a
        boil, and immediately remove from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot
        water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool, peel and
        slice in half. Slice cucumber
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a large skillet or wok, heat 1 cup vegetable oil over
        medium-high heat. Stir in peanuts and cook briefly, until lightly
        browned. Remove peanuts with a slotted spoon and place on paper towels
        to soak up excess grease. Return skillet to stove. Stir in the contents
        of one package anchovies; cook briefly, turning, until crisp. Remove
        with a slotted spoon and place on paper towels. Discard oil. Wipe out
        skillet
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet. Stir in the onion, garlic, and
        shallots; cook until fragrant, about 1 or 2 minutes. Mix in the chile
        paste, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the chile
        paste is too dry, add a small amount of water. Stir in remaining
        anchovies; cook for 5 minutes. Stir in salt, sugar, and tamarind juice;
        simmer until sauce is thick, about 5 minutes
      </li>

        Serve the onion and garlic sauce over the warm rice, and top with
        peanuts, fried anchovies, cucumbers, and eggs
